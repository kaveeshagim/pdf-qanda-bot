# PDF Q&A Bot

A simple web application to ask questions about the contents of a PDF document. It uses [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for the user interface and [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to embed PDF pages and perform question answering using OpenAI's GPT models.

## Features

- Upload any PDF and query its content in natural language.
- Each page of the PDF is embedded and stored in a FAISS vector database for fast retrieval.
- Built with a lightweight Streamlit interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone** the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd pdf-qanda-bot
   ```

2. **Install** the dependencies (Python 3.9+ recommended):

   ```bash
   pip install streamlit langchain faiss-cpu openai
   ```

   You will also need an OpenAI API key to run the application.

## Usage

Run the Streamlit app from the project root:

```bash
streamlit run pdf_qa_bot.py
```

Enter your OpenAI API key when prompted, upload a PDF file, and start asking questions about its content.

## Example

1. Start the application with `streamlit run pdf_qa_bot.py`.
2. Upload a PDF document when prompted.
3. Type a question related to the document and receive an answer generated by the language model.

## Project Structure

- `pdf_qa_bot.py` – Streamlit application code.
- `6. Architectural Design.pdf` – Example PDF included for testing.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or pull requests with improvements or bug fixes.


### Notes
- Keep your OpenAI API key private; do not share or commit it to source control.
- Responses are generated by OpenAI models and may occasionally contain inaccuracies or hallucinations.
